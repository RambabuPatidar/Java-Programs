In this Video we are mainly learning about the access specifier.

four types of access specifier:

Private: Can only be used in the same file. Not anywhere else.

Protected: Can be used inside the package however we want. and outside the package
            can only be used in the subclass.

No specifier: can be used in the package as we want. but not outside the package.

Public : anywhere in the world we can use it as we want.
