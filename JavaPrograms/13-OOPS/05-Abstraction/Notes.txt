    # if we have one or more than one abstract method in a class then that class
      also must be abstract type.
    # And whoever is the subclass of this class the abstract method must be override
      this class abstract methods
    # we use abstract method when we want the subclass to define the body as per their
      requirement and we surely know that this methode should be there in the subclass.
    # we can include instance variable in abstract class.
    # we can also have constructor in abstract class.
    # we can have static methods in abstract classes.

    # abstract Parent(int age); // abstract constructor are not allowed

    abstract static void hello();

    # abstract static method are not allowed because static method can't
      be overridden and on the other hand abstract class must be overridden.
