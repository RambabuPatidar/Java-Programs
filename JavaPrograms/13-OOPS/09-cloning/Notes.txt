Question : why do we need cloning?
Answer : we can copy the object using the constructor of the class and passing the
        object into it. But we are using a new keyword to do that and new keyword
        work at the runtime so this is the overhead and inefficient method. that's why we
        use cloning.

        cloning interface doesn't have anything in that but we implement that to make sure JVM
        knows that we are using clone() inside the class. so that the CloneNotSupportedException
        will not be thrown.


One thing to remember is that cloning in this way creat shallow copy of the object.

Shallow copy:
        it means that the whatever the primitives present in the object will be copied into the new one
        and can be modified. but the non-primitives(objects) inside the object will not be copied
        the reference variable of the cloned object will still point to the same object as previous one.
        that means we can make changes in them via the original object.

Deep Copy:
        This means that when we clone an object then the cloned object should have all the member of its own
        that are cloned and none of this cloned object variable should point to the clone objects.
        i.e. it will have all its objects and primitives independent of the object from which it is cloned.
        and that means that now if we will change this new object the changes were not reflected to the one from which it is cloned.
