Question : what are class(static) variable?
# Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static
  keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
# Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the
  program stops.
# Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name ClassName.
  VariableName.
# There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how
  many objects are created from it.



Question: what are the instance variables?
# Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the
  keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
# Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside
  the class. However, within static methods (when instance variables are given
  accessibility), they should be called using the fully qualified name.
  ObjectReference.VariableName.
# Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or
  any block.
#Instance variables hold values that must be referenced by more than one method,
 constructor or block, or essential parts of an object's state that must be
 present throughout the class.
