So if you had already done Binary trees then BST is exactly
similar to it only few difference are there and these difference contribute
to have BSTs very good properties.

The funda is simple:
we will have a root node.
we will have  left child for that node but condition is that the left child should
    always be less than the root.
we will have right child for the root node but condition is that the right child should
be strictly greater than the root.

and one more rule is that the above properties should also hold true for all
the subtrees of the root.

that is it... really yes.

- BSTs will not have duplicate values.
- BSTs inorder traversal array is sorted
- BSTs do many task in O(h) average time complexity. worst case is O(n) when we have skewed tree


And far more properties are there.

example:                     6
                           /   \
                          3     9
                        /   \  /  \
                       1    4 8    12
